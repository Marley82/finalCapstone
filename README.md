# finalCapstone
This is a project I did as part of my web developer course through Hyperion Dev
I was tasked to make a website that had various features such as contact forms,
'liked' and 'saved' features analogous to a shopping cart and wish list.
The styling is terrible but I liked the principles it helped me learn.

Another task was to upload here with a read me to get me used to the idea of 
doing this as well.

click on 'index' html files to start begin

the other uploaded file is chuckleNoriis which fetches a chuck norris joke every 6 seconds - this is my favourite task so far. load the html file agin to access

first project is a tsraight forward website to use as you would npormally the second you set back and chuckle.
